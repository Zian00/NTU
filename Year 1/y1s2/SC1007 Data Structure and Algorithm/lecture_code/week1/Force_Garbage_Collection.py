# Final count explanation:
# - 41 (or other numver) objects in gen0 are Python's internal objects
#   These include:
#   - Frame objects for function calls
#   - Temporary objects from print statements
#   - Internal references for Python's runtime
#   - System-level temporary objects
# - 0 in gen1 means all middle-aged objects collected
# - 0 in gen2 means all old objects and circular references collected
