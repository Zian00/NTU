# Cannot print count here as no references exist to check   # Object now eligible for garbage collection since reference count is 0
# Cannot print reference count here because:
# 1. After del z, we have no variable name to reference the object
# 2. sys.getrefcount() needs a reference to an object to check its count
# 3. The object [1, 2, 3] is now eligible for garbage collection since no references exist
# print(sys.getrefcount(z)) would raise a NameError: name 'z' is not defined
